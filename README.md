## Introduction to the Project 
Image QC is currently a tedious, mostly-manual process of generating training data on a per-experiment basis. E.g. for a 16-plate dataset approximately 1/3 of the hands-on time goes into this step. The goal of the project is to create a package that takes test image set, and give a quality score to each image and generate a pdf report with examples of LQ images
